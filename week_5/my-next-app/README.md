Next.js Application

Notes

Startup: npx create-next-app@latest "project name"
Typscript: yes
ESLint: yes
Tailwind CSS: yes
`src/` directory: no
App Router: yes
import alias: no

using npm run dev: the code automatically updates on save

App Routing: 
adding new folders to the app folder creates routes
- users folder with page.tsx
    -starting a new react component can type 'rafce' but I think it's a plug in you need for react nextjs
    - adding sub folders will create more specific routes like new

Pages:
pages are rendered in the pages.tsx file (text script)
- works with functions returning html text
